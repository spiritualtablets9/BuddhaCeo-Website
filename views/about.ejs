					<p>
					In today’s connected world, organizations touch many aspects of the lives of
their employees, families and the larger society.  This is because they have
access to and are in control of vast resources in terms of people, material,
technology and money. The more they touch lives in a sympathetic and
responsible manner, the greater is the organizational growth and improvement
in the quality of the lives they touch.

					<p class="mt-5">
					     To implement this most effectively, the mindset of the leadership in terms of
their vision, values and execution ability plays a critical role.  An organizational
leader empowered with a Spirituo-Scientific Mindset will have a higher vision,
empathetic values, friendly and intuitive approach, and responsible execution
ability.</p>

			<div class="col col-lg-12 text">
					<p>
					Small and Medium Enterprises account for the majority of businesses
worldwide and are important contributors to job creation and global economic
development. They represent about 90% of businesses and more than 50% of
employment worldwide.
                     </p>
				<p class="mt-5">
					In India alone, 63+ million companies are MSMEs (Micro, Small and Medium
Enterprises), contributing to significant amount of GDP and producing 100
million jobs.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-5">
					According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), approximately 20%to
30% of new businesses fail during the first two years of being open, 45% during
the first five years, and 65% during the first 10 years, causing much frustration
to their leadership, employees and stake holders. And these statistics have been
quite consistent in these last 30 years.

they touch and the communities they serve.

estimated that there are more than 10 million non-profits and non-governmental
registered organizations worldwide. If non-profits were a country, they would
have the 5th largest economy in the world. And this sector is growing.It is
estimated that about 7% of the people in the world are working for non-profits
in some way or the other, and are touching the lives of billions of people and
the planet.

			<div class="col col-lg-12 text">
					<p>
					     We observe that Leadership – CEO / Founders /Leaders- that is not
compassionate can rarely be sympathetic and responsible to others. Leadership
that is limited by rigid beliefs, thinking or values can almost never succeed in
growing a sustainable business or organization neither creating more resources
for others. Leadership that tends to act greedy or with excessive control over
teams, can hardly ever enable others to innovate and contribute to the
organization growth. Leadership that lacks vision or clarity in strategy and
execution can by no means deliver performance and make a difference.
The core reasons for this kind of traits and resulting lack of performance can
easily be improved and overcome by any founder and leader through
transforming and empowering themselves with a “Spirituo-Scientific” Mindset,
built from the breath-mindfulness meditation-based wisdom and techniques.
This does apply to all students as they are the leaders of tomorrow. In India
alone, 250 million students were going to school in 2019, including more than
37 million in higher education. More and more schools and universities around
the world are enabling the new generations with mindfulness &amp;meditation
techniques, and companies like IBM have even introduced these techniques for
the P-TECH schools that they are sponsoring. Developing “spirituo-scientific”
minded students is a formidable transformative opportunity for the individuals,
the economy and society in general.
