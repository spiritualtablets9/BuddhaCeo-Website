	"About why the foundation title": "Why The Foundation",
	"About why the foundation description 1": "In today’s connected world, organizations touch many aspects of the lives of their employees, families and the larger society.  This is because they have access to and are in control of vast resources in terms of people, material, technology and money. The more they touch lives in a sympathetic and responsible manner, the greater is the organizational growth and improvement in the quality of the lives they touch.",
	"About why the foundation description 2": "To implement this most effectively, the mindset of the leadership in terms of their vision, values and execution ability plays a critical role.

	"About the essential role of leadership title": "The Essential Role of Leadership",
	"About the essential role of leadership description": "We observe that Leadership – CEO / Founders /Leaders- that is not compassionate can rarely be sympathetic and responsible to others. Leadership that is limited by rigid beliefs, thinking or values can almost never succeed in growing a sustainable business or organization neither creating more resources for others. Leadership that tends to act greedy or with excessive control over teams, can hardly ever enable others to innovate and contribute to the organization growth. Leadership that lacks vision or clarity in strategy and execution can by no means deliver performance and make a difference. The core reasons for this kind of traits and resulting lack of performance can easily be improved and overcome by any founder and leader through transforming and empowering themselves with a “Spirituo-Scientific” Mindset, built from the breath-mindfulness meditation-based wisdom and techniques. <br> <br>This does apply to all students as they are the leaders of tomorrow. In India alone, 250 million students were going to school in 2019, including more than 37 million in higher education. More and more schools and universities around the world are enabling the new generations with mindfulness &meditation techniques, and companies like IBM have even introduced these techniques for the P-TECH schools that they are sponsoring. Developing “spirituo-scientific” minded students is a formidable transformative opportunity for the individuals, the economy and society in general.",
